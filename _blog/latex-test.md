Does this work?

$2 + 3 = 5$

woah it does??

What about something more complicated
like

$$
\begin{align*}
  2 + 3 &= 5 \\
  2 + 3 &= x \\
  \therefore x &= 5
\end{align*}
$$

And something silly like

$$
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{k=1}^n k &= 1 + 2 + \dots + n \\
                 &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\end{align*}
$$
