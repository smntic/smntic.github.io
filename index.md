# Welcome

Hi! I'm Simon, a second-year computer science student at Simon Fraser
University with over a decade of passion for computing. In recent years, I've
taken on more complex projects and coursework. My interests in CS include
efficient software development methods, reinforcement learning and artificial
life. Alongside my studies, I actively practice competitive programming.
