                    <a className="link" href="https://github.com/smntic/SynthScript">GitHub Repository</a>

                <p>
                    <strong>SynthScript</strong> is a dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language designed from the ground up to utilize intuitive syntax and accessible built-in functions, including capabilities for reading from and writing to files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language is implemented in C++ without relying on external libraries like Yacc or Bison. It employs a polymorphic approach to dynamic typing, utilizing an <code>std::map</code> for the symbol table to store variables and functions. The abstract syntax tree is constructed recursively, leveraging polymorphism to define classes for the tree nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Various design decisions were made to enhance intuitiveness. For example, the assignment operator is represented by an arrow (‚Üê), allowing the comparison operator to use a single equals sign (=):
                </p>
                <CodeBlock text={equalsSample} language="R" theme={zenburn} />
                <p>
                    Additionally, SynthScript simplifies loop syntax by adopting a Python-like approach with a more intuitive <code>range</code> operator:
                </p>
                <CodeBlock text={loopSample} language="R" theme={zenburn} />
                <p>
                    Below is an example of a program written in SynthScript that counts the number of words in a file:
                </p>
                <CodeBlock text={wordsInFileSample} language="R" theme={zenburn} />
                <p>
                    SynthScript also includes testing using <b>doctest</b>. This was a significant improvement to the stability of the language, as it caught many bugs that appeared during early development.
                    It uses <b>GitHub Actions</b> for continuous integration, which automatically runs the test suite on a gamut of compilation environments for every push to the repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is unlikely to be maintained at this point, since the language is not intended for practical use. However, it was a valuable learning experience in language design and implementation, and I practiced my testing skills by writing a comprehensive test suite.
